## 🧩 OVERVIEW

**Ownuh SecurePass Analyzer** is a **professional-grade graphical password auditing tool** designed to help users **analyze, visualize, and strengthen passwords**.  
It combines **entropy-based scoring**, **pattern detection**, and **policy-driven evaluation** with rich **visual feedback**, empowering individuals and organizations to understand their password strength in real time.

---

## ⚙️ FEATURES

* 📊 **Entropy Calculation:** Uses Shannon Entropy to measure randomness and predict strength.  
* 🚦 **Dynamic Strength Classification:** Instantly classifies from Very Weak → Very Strong.  
* 🔍 **Pattern Recognition:** Detects keyboard patterns, dictionary words, years, sequences, and repeated characters.  
* 🧠 **Smart Suggestions:** Generates stronger password alternatives using leet-style mutations, symbol insertions, and capitalization mixes.  
* 🔒 **Policy Compliance Engine:** Customizable corporate-grade policy (length, character types, special symbols).  
* 📈 **Entropy Growth Graph:** Live graph that shows entropy increase as you type.  
* 🎨 **Heatmap Visualization:** Visual complexity map highlighting weak segments of a password.  
* 🧾 **Bulk Analyzer:** Import hundreds of passwords via CSV and export detailed reports.  
* 💾 **Session Logging:** Save your analysis history as `.csv` or `.txt`.  
* 🌙 **Dark/Light Theme:** Switch seamlessly between light and dark interfaces.  
* 🧰 **Clipboard Safety:** Optional timed clipboard clearing for enhanced privacy.

## 🧮 ENTROPY REFERENCE

| Entropy (bits) | Classification | Example Crack Time (@1e9 guesses/sec) |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| < 28           | 🔴 Very Weak   | Instant                               |
| 28–35          | 🟠 Weak        | Seconds–Minutes                       |
| 36–59          | 🟡 Moderate    | Hours–Days                            |
| 60–79          | 🟢 Strong      | Years                                 |
| ≥ 80           | 🟣 Very Strong | Thousands of Years                    |

## 🧰 BUILD (Optional for Developers)

You can build standalone executables using **PyInstaller** or **GitHub Actions**.

### Manual build:

```bash
pyinstaller --noconfirm --clean --onefile --windowed \
  --add-data "images/logo.png:images" \
  --icon=assets/app.ico \
  ownuh_securepass_analyzer.py
```

### GitHub Actions build:

Automated builds are configured in `.github/workflows/build.yml`.
Tag your release with:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The workflow will build Windows, macOS, and Linux binaries and upload them to the **Releases** page.

## 🛡️ SECURITY & PRIVACY NOTICE

**Ownuh SecurePass Analyzer** is designed with privacy in mind:

* **No passwords are stored or transmitted** outside your local machine unless you explicitly export them.  
* **Optional breach checking** uses the **Have I Been Pwned** k-anonymity API — only partial SHA-1 hash prefixes are sent, never your full password.  
* Session logs are **local only**, and sensitive passwords are **masked by default** in history views and CSV exports.  
* Clipboard operations are manual and can be **cleared automatically** after use for safety.  

By design, this tool ensures your sensitive data **remains private and under your control** at all times.
